# Important Terms
- *Triad*: we are using the Carlton Gamer / Howard Hanson definition of triad, referring to "a three-note pitch collection which is not necessarily a contiguous segment of a scale or a tone row and not necessarily (in twentieth-century music) tertian or diatonic either.[citation needed]"

- *BIFFUD Chord Index*: our scientists have discovered a way to convert a single number to a three note chord, provided that number is an integer between 0 and 109735.  This set of numbers defines the BIFFUD Chord Index.

- *Coord Progression*: a single geocoordinate will provide an accurate location at a resolution of a 50 milex50 mile grid.  Although we feel that is good enough, we recognize that some others might feel that it is necessary to get more specific, which is why we invented coord progressions.  By playing two chords in a row you can get down to a 10 acre landmark, and by playing three chords you can get to a 5 meter square.  We believe that it is possible to have a four chord coord progression, but have not seen this tested and are scared of the potential consequences.
