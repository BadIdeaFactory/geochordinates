# Geohash Notes
This npm package makes it possible to seamlessly move back and forth between sounds and geolocations.  This is a useful idea that we expect to find all sorts of unexpected and highly relevant applications.

## Installation
Once we have an initial version, this will be on npm.  Once that happens you will install it by typing:

`npm install geohash-notes`

## How to Contribute

1.  Read [the glossary](GLOSSARY.md), make sure you understand the terms.
2.  Fork this repository, make your contributions.
3.  Issue a pull request, which will promptly be reviewed.

Eventually we want unit tests.  Want to set those up?  That would be awesome.

Idk I guess that's good enough for now.
